 Sift the dry ingredients into a large bowl first to get rid of any hard lumps caused during storage, while getting more air into the mixture.

Then add in your wet ingredients. Just keep in mind that the cake batter is VERY thin. Donâ€™t be tempted to add more flour as this is what makes the cake super soft and moist.

The ONLY thing you can add to this already perfect cake recipe is a couple teaspoons of instant coffee or espresso for an even deeper chocolate flavour. Of course, this is totally and COMPLETELY optional. You cannot taste the coffee flavour.

Super-fine cake flour can be used if you have it for an even softer crumb but is not necessary.
